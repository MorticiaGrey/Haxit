# Haxit

Haxit is a hacking game, but one disimilar to any which I have encountered. Though it's in its infancy, Haxit is meant to be a more realistic representation of 'hacking' than that which is found in the average "type four commands and hack anything" games. At the moment the computers in Haxit are relatively simple, though I have plans to change that as time goes on.

The beta release is out and ready for play, though there is still much work to be done. Documentation and tutorials can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/MorticiaGrey/Haxit/wiki), I'll be happy to help out with any issues you have if you join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/RKUXN9k9wQ) or open an issue on the github, and I am especially happy to receive feedback if you have it. That said, Happy Hacking!

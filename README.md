# Haxit

Haxit is a hacking game, but one unlike any which has existed before. Unlike other hacking games, you actually have to do some hacking, getting into the nitty gritty
of networking in order to accomplish your goals. Also unlike other games, you can design your own computers to hack or hack those designed by other people.

At the moment Haxit is in it's beta, and as such several features will be added later to flesh out the game play and smoothen the process of playing. The simulated
computers are also a little simplistic at the moment, and as time goes on will more closely resemble their real life counter parts. 

The game is very much usable now, and a wiki is available to help guide you through setting it up. There's also a discord server linked on the wiki where you can 
ask questions, make suggestions, and otherwise interact with the community. Happy hacking!
